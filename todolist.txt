maybe add priority target to skirmishers->above:

anti-cav:
	make hold-the-line inherent, but at +5 instead of +10

readjust naval ranged tree?:
	move +1 range earlier, move damage a little more inconveient

buff harbors next to city center:
	lighthouses give instant trader if adjacent to coast?
	harbor train naval units 25% faster?

privateers:
	better promotion tree that actually scales

carthage:
	city move project should be way cheaper, only scaling with times used
	bireme to 40 str?

quarries:
	make them not bad lmao

wonders:
	make huey tocali not shit
	great lighthouse at +2 move? may be a lil broken
	statue of zeus at military tradition, reduce cost

pantheons:
	firegoddess = make tile improvements (maybe districts?) unpillagable by volcanos
	godofhealing = add a +15/25% production to holysites?
	godofwar = redo this
	initationrites = clearing barb camp gives you strongest melee unit
	religiousidols = redo this
	stone circles = redo this

world congress:
	give ability to choose more resolutions/actions
