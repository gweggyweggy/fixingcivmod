///codebase todos///

thismod:
	rename to 6fix, possibly divide into 6 seperate mods as a bundle?


cleanup formatting and refactor appropiately

standardize naming conventions

specify load order for all files

keep README/desc updated

find out if:  long load times due to xml replaces or # of updatedb/text calls?  (a computer restart seemed to fix, so maybe not related to modding)

figure out proper localization for new text entries

///gameplay todos///
===difficulty estimates:===
1 = trivial, should take no time at all
2 = seems straightforward, may be some hiccups here and there
3 = will take some effort and research to accomplish, but should be doable
4 = seems complex, may need a lot more research and testing to accomplish
5 = may be near impossible, maybe rethink this proposal


-----DIFFICULTY 1s:-----

update highlander to match with new recon unit

fix some of the wrong eureka descs:
	siege tactics, shd be two trebuchets now
	something else i dont remember? check april patch notes

update text for new nonspecialty districts

-----DIFFICULTY 2s:-----
shipyards:
	production to all coastal tiles, not just unimproved

add desc for what the coastal modifier is (e.g. +2 production from (2 adjacent coastal tiles)), is there a LOC_ value?



-----DIFFICULTY 3s:-----


firegoddess = make tile improvements (maybe districts?) unpillagable by volcanos


godofhealing = add a +15/25% production to holysites?

babylon:
	double unit maintenance cost?



-----DIFFICULTY 4s:-----
kongo:
	make mbanzas more resilient to recruit partisans





privateers:
	better promotion tree that actually scales

readjust naval ranged tree?:
	move +1 range earlier, move damage a little more inconveient


-----DIFFICULTY 5s:-----

huey teocalli:
	make adj bonus apply only to lake tiles (need to specify a nwe terraintype with current implementation).  once that's done, reenable harbor adjacencies

military engineers:
	build forts in enemy territory

recon:
	maybe add priority target to skirmishers->above:
	i see PRIORITY_TARGET existing, but theres nothing else in the db that it explicitly attaches itself into

naval combat:
	theres something in the db about PrevailingWinds?  would like to add some dynamic movement/combat bonuses for naval combat

----BACKLOG-----

anti early snowball:
	harsher research penalty for going past current era tech/civic?
	loyalty pressure more of a problem in earlier eras, should certain techs or civics fix this or global era progression?


stacked trees:
	more crazy fun abilites in normally worthless techs/civics 
		e.g. +1 charge to all builders at some civic
		builders can rush certain districts/buildings past certain civics
		nationalism should boost loyalty in founded cities


with new mili engie changes, road spam might be an issue.


make mod not depend in Rise and fall: should be trivial, but who knows what breaks


carthage:
	bireme shd get +5/10 when near a friendly trade route?

wonders:
	great lighthouse?
	colossus?
	angkor wat: make it way more impactful for taller civs 
	hanging gardens: not sure what to do
	sankore?
	stonehenge, quarries give faith? maybe when founding a religion, gain another belief?
	
pantheons:
	godofwar = redo this
	initationrites = clearing barb camp gives you strongest melee unit?
	religiousidols = redo this
	stone circles = redo this

world congress:
	give ability to choose more resolutions/actions

tlacthi:
	redo the effect to more unit oriented (+1 gen is kinda lame)

kongo:
	let them build holy sites, but not recruit prophet
	in turn, get archelogists and reveal artifacts early at humanism

nam:
	voi chiens?  maybe more expensive

kupe:
	maybe make him unable to remove features?  pretty harsh, but thematic


specialists?

should fighters only cost 1 alum as they are meant for more defensive measures compared to bombers?

make polders more spammable

may nerf coastal prod adj to every 2 if better balanced start works too well

machine guns should come before infantry and tanks, like why are tanks modern but machine guns atomic?

spies should come in way earlier (near end of ancient), but have their offensive capabilites and movement times severely nerfed until renaissance picks up
	black queen should pick up at medieval

alliances:
	alliances should only require one person to know what they are
	earlier for cree
	

military academies:
	add additoinal benefit to mili engs, maybe 2 engies for 1?

china:
	move builder charge to chinas main ability?

siege tactics:  
	units gain additional defensive bonus in forts
	do the same for roman fort and pa

crossbows are not as strong as they used to be since man-at-arms update bumped everything up in the medieival era, maybe its for the better though?

scythia:
	make horse archers cost horses, but maybe also give them the ability to move and shoot? (must reduce melee strength if thats the case)

mongolia:
	archers->keshigs?  that might be broken

make music censorship more punishing to slot in:
	this may fuck up the ai really badly, need to be careful

defensive tactics:
	additional support bonuses?

fix ai science value

give eleanor kongos great people gen (with writing)

make martry give relics upon condemn heretic

earlier form of propaganda called something like "warrior culture", buff propaganda appropiately

change religious community:

zen meditation, 1 amenity for every specialty, not just 2
