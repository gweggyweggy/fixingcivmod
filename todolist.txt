///codebase todos///

thismod:
	rename to 6fix, possibly divide into 6 seperate mods as a bundle?


cleanup formatting and refactor appropiately

make a changelog

specify load order for all files

keep README/desc updated

make section for new devs

find out if:  long load times due to xml replaces or # of updatedb/text calls?

===difficulty estimates:===
1 = trivial, should take no time at all
2 = seems straightforward, may be some hiccups here and there
3 = will take some effort and research to accomplish, but should be doable
4 = seems complex, may need a lot more research and testing to accomplish
5 = may be near impossible, maybe rethink this proposal
? = unsure what to do/go forward with, come back to these later


-----DIFFICULTY 1s:-----

stables:
	move to animal husbandry
	reduce cost to 90

spearman:
	production nerf to 55

coursers and knights:
	reduce cost of both by 10

fix some of the wrong eureka descs:
	siege tactics, shd be two trebuchets now
	something else i dont remember? check patch notes

-----DIFFICULTY 2s:-----
shipyards:
	production to all coastal tiles, not just unimproved

add desc for what the coastal modifier is (e.g. +2 production from (2 adjacent coastal tiles)), is there a LOC_ value?

kongo:
	make mbanzas more resilient to recruit partisans


-----DIFFICULTY 3s:-----


military academies:
	add additoinal benefit to mili engs, maybe 2 engies for 1?
	


--these are techmodifiers
siege tactics:  bonuses for defender and attacker
	+5 to city strike, +5 bonus to units when attacking cities and when defending against city strikes
	can place forts on features (improvement_valid features, put in prereq tech) 
	forts: gain additional defensive bonus in siege tactics
	do the same for roman fort and pa

military tactics:
	increased flanking and support bonuses
defensive tactics:
	+5 to units defending in certain circumstances (maybe?)

will need to add policy cards for support and siege units with all the new defensive buffs


firegoddess = make tile improvements (maybe districts?) unpillagable by volcanos



godofhealing = add a +15/25% production to holysites?

babylon:
	double unit maintenance cost?



-----DIFFICULTY 4s:-----

huey teocalli:
	make adj bonus apply only to lake tiles (need to specify a nwe terraintype with current implementation).  once that's done, reenable harbor adjacencies

amenities:
	make negative amenities more harmful since entercs are free now
	make lowest amenity have -20 loyalty or something
	make war weariness actually matter
	occupied cities should suffer the most

privateers:
	better promotion tree that actually scales

readjust naval ranged tree?:
	move +1 range earlier, move damage a little more inconveient

warrior monks: 
	instaunlock theology when founding warrior monk religion
	redo promotion tree:
		one promotion should ignore walls (like siege tower)

-----DIFFICULTY 5s:-----
military engineers:
	build forts in enemy territory

recon:
	maybe add priority target to skirmishers->above:
	i see PRIORITY_TARGET existing, but theres nothing else in the db that it explicitly attaches itself into

naval combat:
	theres something in the db about PrevailingWinds?  would like to add some dynamic movement/combat bonuses for naval combat

----DIFFICULTY ?s:-----

anti early snowball:
	harsher research penalty for going past current era tech/civic?
	loyalty pressure more of a problem in earlier eras, should certain techs or civics fix this or global era progression?

anti turtle:
	on the other hand, need to prevent turtling from being too efficient. game already favors the defender
	

stacked trees:
	more crazy fun abilites in normally worthless techs/civics 
		e.g. +1 charge to all builders at some civic
		builders can rush certain districts/buildings past certain civics
		nationalism should boost loyalty in founded cities


with new mili engie changes, road spam might be an issue.

reduce heavy chariot cost by 5?

make mod not depend in Rise and fall: should be trivial, but who knows what breaks

mathematics:
	make it do something useful?

carthage:
	bireme shd get +5/10 when near a friendly trade route?

wonders:
	great lighthouse?
	colossus?
	angkor wat: make it way more impactful for taller civs 
	hanging gardens: not sure what to do
	sankore?
	buff machu picchu slighty?  maybe +2 adj to at least theatre squares and commercial hubs?
	
pantheons:
	godofwar = redo this
	initationrites = clearing barb camp gives you strongest melee unit?
	religiousidols = redo this
	stone circles = redo this

world congress:
	give ability to choose more resolutions/actions

tlacthi:
	redo the effect to more unit oriented (+1 gen is kinda lame)

kongo:
	let them build holy sites, but not recruit prophet
	maybe make killing units a chance to grant relic/artifact?  in turn, get archelogists and reveal artifacts early

nam:
	voi chiens?  maybe more expensive

kupe:
	maybe make him unable to remove features?  pretty harsh, but thematic

stonehenge, quarries give faith? maybe when founding a religion, gain another belief?

specialists?

should fighters only cost 1 alum as they are meant for more defensive measures compared to bombers?

make polders more spammable

may nerf coastal prod adj to every 2, but playtesting will determine that

machine guns should come before infantry and tanks, like why are tanks modern but machine guns atomic?
