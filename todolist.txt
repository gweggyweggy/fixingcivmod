thismod:
	rename to 6fix, possibly divide into 6 seperate mods as a bundle?


recon:
	maybe add priority target to skirmishers->above:

warrior monks: 
	redo promotion tree:
		one promotion should ignore walls (like siege tower)

anti-cav:
	make hold-the-line inherent, but at +5 instead of +10

readjust naval ranged tree?:
	move +1 range earlier, move damage a little more inconveient

rewarding coastal cities:
	maybes?:
		lighthouses give instant trader if adjacent to coast?
		or lighthouses also give production like a shipyard?
		or lighthouses now give gold=harbor adjacency instead of +1 gold (srsly wtf?)
		i think the best way to improve this is to make trading more impactful for these coastal cities
