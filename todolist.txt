///codebase todos///

thismod:
	rename to 6fix, possibly divide into 6 seperate mods as a bundle?


cleanup formatting and refactor appropiately

standardize naming conventions

specify load order for all files

keep README/desc updated

find out if:  long load times due to xml replaces or # of updatedb/text calls?  (a computer restart seemed to fix, so maybe not related to modding)

figure out proper localization for new text entries

///gameplay todos///
===difficulty estimates:===
1 = trivial, should take no time at all
2 = seems straightforward, may be some hiccups here and there
3 = will take some effort and research to accomplish, but should be doable
4 = seems complex, may need a lot more research and testing to accomplish
5 = may be near impossible, maybe rethink this proposal

	5% faith for each person you met that isnt warring you. 15% if friend, 20% if ally
