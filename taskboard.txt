==TASKS==


new policy cards for recon production (combine discipline with survey later on in the game?)



==DEVELOPING==
warrior monks: become ultimate meme unit

	redo promotion tree:
		one promotion should ignore walls (like siege tower)
		can we enable ki blasts (similar to gdr ranged attack?)
		disciples as 1st promotion, add combat strength here
		what if walk on water?





==UPDATING TEXTS==
	only require shrines to be built, but have 35 starting strength.
	get more strength via certain civics (theology, reformed churhc, mass media, professional sports)

==FINAL TESTING==


==BACKLOGGED==

==DONE==

recon:
	new promotion tree:
adjusting small things for weariness, need to playtest to see actual changes
