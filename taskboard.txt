==TASKS==

recon:
	new promotion tree:
		left side: woodsmen, spyglass + see through features, camouflage
		right side: guerilla, ignore zoc, pillaging takes 1 move (maybe also spawn rebel units as meme?)
		final promotion still ambush, but only applies against land units

readjust recon strengths, costs, and ranges
skirmishers at construction?

new policy cards for recon production (combine discipline with survey later on in the game?)

warrior monks: become ultimate meme unit
	instaunlock theology when founding warrior monk religion
	redo promotion tree:
		one promotion should ignore walls (like siege tower)
		can we enable ki blasts (similar to gdr ranged attack?)
	get more strength via certain civics (reformed churhc, mass media, professional sports)

==DEVELOPING==
