This mod is similar to BBG but a lot less ambitious.


Specifically, this mod attempts to keep the basic Vanilla experience intact by slightly tuning the units, buildings, civs, etc. 
while only dramatically revamping things I believe to be drastically revamped (in my opinion)
Big thanks to the guys at BBG for having their code on github for me to reference/steal.
