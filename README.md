This mod is similar to BBG but takes a different approach to balancing.
There are several global balance changes done by adjusting the tech and civic trees, as well as some other general changes such as (but not limited to):
1. coastal cities get production each adj coastal tile
2. anticav units have an inherent hold-the-line ability (only at +3)
3. man at arms moved to military engineering and production cost increased, as well as other unit shuffles throughout the tech tree
4. new abilities unlocked at previously useless techs (military tactics actually providing combat bonuses) [To be implemented]
and more!

There are also specific changes to Civs and their units as well.

Full changelog will be made at some point once I'm happy with what I want for an initial release

Big thanks to the guys at BBG for having their code on github for me to reference/copy.
