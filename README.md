This mod is similar to BBG but a lot less ambitious.


Specifically, this mod attempts to keep the basic Vanilla experience intact by slightly tuning the units, buildings, civs, etc. 
while only dramatically revamping things I believe to be drastically revamped (in my opinion)
Big thanks to the guys at BBG for having their code on github for me to reference/steal.

BALANCE CHANGES:

Developer notes:
	This mod was made via ModBuddy, from the official Civ 6 development tools.
	The modinfo file (i.e. the driver for this mod) is generated/customized via the .sln > Properties > InGameActions > UpdateDatabase

	Further development:
		Database entries can be found using a sql browser such as DB Browser for SQL lite.  
		The database in question you will want to investigate is probably in Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Cache\DebugGameplay
		A lot of important stuff is in the ModifierArguments table
